1.	A glass manufacturing plant uses different earth elements to 
design new glass materials based on customer requirements. 
For that, they would like to automate the process of classification
as itâ€™s a tedious job to manually classify them. Help the company 
achieve its objective by correctly classifying the glass type based 
on the other features using KNN algorithm.
